<p>I'm having issues with deployment, if someone can help I'd appreciate it.</p>

## Overview

A [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) clone made with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand). This project was a great learning experience for me, I learnt a lot about CSS grids, custom hooks in React, using state management libraries like Zustand, and how to use testing tools ([Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) in this case).
